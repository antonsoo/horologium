/**
 * "Use my location", with every way it can end accounted for.
 *
 * `getCurrentPosition` answers through one of two callbacks, except when it doesn't: Firefox
 * calls neither when its permission prompt is closed without a choice ("Not now", Escape, a
 * click elsewhere), and the `timeout` option only starts counting once permission is
 * given. A page that waits for a callback then says "Locating..." until it is reloaded.
 * So the wait has a limit of its own, after which the page is told the browser has not
 * answered. A late answer still counts: someone may simply be reading the prompt.
